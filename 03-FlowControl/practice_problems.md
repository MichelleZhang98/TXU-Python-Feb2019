# Practice Problems


## More loops!

## Problem 1
Write a program which will find all numbers between 2000 and 3200 (both inclusive), which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5. Store the answers in a list. Print the list.

## Problem 2
Write a program that takes a number as an input, computes the factorial of the number enterred, and then prints the result. *You must use a loop.* You may not use any libraries or math functions that calculate factorials.
* (Hint: a factorial is just the product of all numbers between 1 and the number. So, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.)

## Problem 3
Write a program that accepts an input, and then calculate the number of letters and digits in the entered string.
For example, this input:
hello world! 123
should return this output:
LETTERS 10
DIGITS 3

## Problem 4
Create a standalone python script (.py file, not a .ipynb notebook) that asks a user for an input, does something (eg, prints user's input) repeatedly in an infinite loop, but quits if the first letter of the user input is a 'q' or a 'Q'
